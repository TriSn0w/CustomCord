## What is CustomCord?
CustomCord is a custom version of Discord made using Electron. It is based on my old Discord client, [ElectroCord](https://github.com).

## How to install
Firstly, go to the releases tab and download the latest release.

Once download is finished, extract it, make sure you have these two things:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- npm

Finally, start your command prompt, direct it to the location of the client, and do ``npm start``.

## Usage
You can use CustomCord to talk and chat with friends, join servers, and more.

## Notice
I am not responsible if you get banned off discord from using this client.
Also, This client is COMPLETELY open-sourced, so if you want, you can fork it and add your own things to it :smile:
